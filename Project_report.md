Project Report

Idea :
Thoroughly understand the working of javascript by implementing a game which aims at creating a 2d version of table tennis.
Aims at adding in possibly all the features provided by the large collection of javscript libraries which is in the scope of the games.

Technology:
The game is purely made out of html and javascript.
It uses canvas tag of the html for graphics.
No javascript library has been used intentionally to understand and learn to code in simple javascript first to a good level.
This is because i feel libraries provide a lot of abstraction and hide the details of the language
Event listesers are used to interact with the game while playing it.

Future Scope:
The future scope is immense!
1. Multiplayer mode can be brought in.
2. Paddles can be made to move in x directions as well
3. Game of 4 with 2 players in each side
4. Play across computer.(We can use flask to create a server and play in the local network with friends)
5. IMPORTANT : Also implement the following game and many other games as chrome extensions.

My experience!
Building my first project and submitting it in github has made me feel proud!
My first plan was in building chrome extensions with games in it which provides a way to relax while studying online
For extension, i began learning JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) format. But i got stuck at understanding the chrome API's and it forced me to proceed just with game.

Realizing how the physics sinks with the game amazed me!
In the process of building a game, i have fundamental understanding of javscript and would love to contribute to other web - development projects.
